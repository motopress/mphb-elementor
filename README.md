[Hotel Booking & Elementor Integration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mphb-elementor/) plugin is a utility that bridges the MotoPress [Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/) with the Elementor page builder.

MotoPress Hotel Booking is a fully-featured solution for creating a directory of rental properties, accepting online reservations and syncing them to OTAs, such as HomeAway or Airbnb.

Using the Hotel Booking Elementor Integration addon, you get numerous options to edit the content generated by Hotel Booking with the help of Elementor widgets instead of WordPress shortcodes.
